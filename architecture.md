# E-Library Semantic Search Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the E-Library Semantic Search system. The system will organize academic resources using an ontology and enable SPARQL-based search capabilities.

## Components

### 1. Ontology Design
The core of the system is an OWL ontology that models academic resources and their relationships. The ontology will be developed using Protégé and will include:

- **Classes**: Representing different types of academic resources (books, journals, articles, theses, etc.) and related entities (authors, publishers, subjects, etc.)
- **Object Properties**: Representing relationships between entities (e.g., hasAuthor, publishedBy, relatedTo)
- **Data Properties**: Representing attributes of entities (e.g., title, publicationDate, ISBN)
- **Annotations**: Providing metadata about entities and properties
- **Restrictions**: Defining constraints on classes and properties

### 2. Data Layer
Sample academic resource data will be created in RDF format, conforming to the ontology structure. This will include:

- Sample books, journals, articles, and other academic resources
- Author information
- Subject classifications
- Publication details

### 3. Query Layer
SPARQL queries will be developed to enable semantic search capabilities:

- Basic search queries (by title, author, subject)
- Advanced semantic queries (related resources, resources by topic hierarchy)
- Inference-based queries (utilizing OWL reasoning)

### 4. Application Layer
A simple interface will be created to demonstrate the search functionality:

- Query input mechanism
- Results display
- Basic filtering options

## Ontology Structure

### Main Classes
- **AcademicResource** (top-level class)
  - **Book**
  - **Journal**
  - **Article**
  - **Thesis**
  - **ConferencePaper**
  - **TechnicalReport**

### Supporting Classes
- **Person** (for authors, editors)
- **Publisher**
- **Subject** (hierarchical subject classification)
- **Institution** (universities, research centers)

### Key Object Properties
- **hasAuthor**: Links resources to their authors
- **publishedBy**: Links resources to publishers
- **hasTopic**: Links resources to subjects
- **cites**: Links resources to other resources they reference
- **relatedTo**: Links resources with semantic relationships

### Key Data Properties
- **title**: Title of the resource
- **publicationDate**: Date of publication
- **abstract**: Summary of the resource
- **keywords**: Keywords associated with the resource
- **identifier**: ISBN, DOI, or other identifiers

## Search Capabilities
The semantic search will support:

1. **Keyword-based search**: Finding resources containing specific terms
2. **Semantic relationship search**: Finding resources related to a given resource
3. **Topic-based search**: Finding resources on specific topics, including subtopics
4. **Author-based search**: Finding resources by specific authors
5. **Citation-based search**: Finding resources that cite or are cited by a given resource

## Implementation Approach
1. Develop the ontology in Protégé
2. Create sample RDF data conforming to the ontology
3. Implement SPARQL queries for different search scenarios
4. Create a simple interface to demonstrate the search functionality
5. Document the system and its capabilities

This architecture addresses the project requirements and grading criteria, with particular focus on ontology design, SPARQL queries, and OWL features.
