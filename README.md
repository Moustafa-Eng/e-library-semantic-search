# E-Library Semantic Search

A semantic search system for academic resources using ontology and SPARQL-based search capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project implements an E-Library Semantic Search system that organizes academic resources using an ontology and enables SPARQL-based search. The system allows users to search for academic resources based on various criteria such as title, author, subject, and publication date, as well as semantic relationships between resources.

## Features

- **Ontology-Based Data Model**: Academic resources are organized using an OWL ontology with classes, properties, and relationships.
- **Semantic Search Capabilities**: SPARQL queries enable advanced search based on semantic relationships.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for searching and exploring academic resources.
- **Multiple Search Types**:
  - Search by title, author, subject, or keyword
  - Search by publication date range
  - Find interdisciplinary resources
  - Find most cited resources
  - Find collaborating authors
  - Find related resources
  - Get recommendations for similar resources

## Technologies Used

- **Protégé**: Web ontology editor for creating the OWL ontology
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation
- **RDFLib**: Python library for working with RDF data
- **Flask**: Web framework for the user interface
- **SPARQL**: Query language for RDF data
- **OWL**: Web Ontology Language for defining the ontology
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-library-semantic-search.git
cd e-library-semantic-search
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install rdflib owlready2 flask
```

3. Run the application:
```
python src/app.py
```

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Select a search type from the dropdown menu (e.g., Search by Title, Search by Author)
2. Enter your search query in the input field
3. Click the Search button to see the results
4. For special search types like "Find Interdisciplinary Resources" or "Find Most Cited Resources", no query input is needed
5. Use the buttons on search results to find similar resources, related resources, or citing resources

## Ontology Structure

The ontology includes the following main classes:
- **AcademicResource**: Top-level class for all academic resources
  - **Book**: Published books
  - **Journal**: Academic journals
  - **Article**: Scholarly articles (JournalArticle, ConferenceArticle)
  - **Thesis**: Academic theses (MastersThesis, DoctoralThesis)
  - **ConferencePaper**: Papers presented at conferences
  - **TechnicalReport**: Technical reports
- **Person**: People involved in academic resources (Author, Editor, Researcher)
- **Organization**: Organizations (Publisher, University, ResearchInstitution)
- **Subject**: Academic subjects and fields
- **Event**: Academic events (Conference)

Key relationships include:
- hasAuthor: Links resources to authors
- publishedBy: Links resources to publishers
- hasTopic: Links resources to subjects
- cites: Links resources to cited resources
- relatedTo: Links semantically related resources

## SPARQL Queries

The system implements various SPARQL queries for semantic search, including:
- Basic search queries (by title, author, subject)
- Advanced semantic queries (related resources, resources by topic hierarchy)
- Inference-based queries (utilizing OWL reasoning)
- Complex queries (most cited resources, interdisciplinary resources)

## Testing

Run the tests to verify the functionality:
```
python -m tests.test_semantic_search
```

## Live Demo

The application is deployed and accessible at:
